What do you need to manage a project?
# Backlog
The user stories we defined in the 3rd step of planning have to be frequently consulted and updated, alongside bugs that pop up and must be resolved. This is done in something called a Backlog, used by everyone in the team.

This usually involves a platform with a Kanban board. Ideally you'd associate it with a [VCS](Glossary.md#VCS), so you can see what it took to complete the task, along with other VCS information. This integration is normally done by platforms like GitHub and Azure DevOps.

# Time Management
As a developer, It's important to develop a good sense of how long it takes you to develop things. Platforms like Jira or Leantime allow you to input work hours in tasks which are usually the simplest way, but using a notepad or excel sheet can be sufficient too.

Scrum Masters/Product Owners shouldn't micromanage Developer's timeframes, just check-in to see how much progress has been done.

# Version Control System
You should always use a VCS to keep track of code changes, not only so you can know what work you did when in the future, but most importantly so that when you change something that breaks the code, you can see what code is new and focus on that.

Please always use a VCS on any programming project of any scale. I put it at the bottom because it's obvious, not due to irrelevancy.
