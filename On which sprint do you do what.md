Once all the high level goals are defined, you have a list of user stories that Developers can tackle, and you know which technologies to use, you have to decide what to prioritize for a given Sprint.

This is done by the Product Owner in conjunction with the Scrum Master + whoever they choose to delegate this to. The goal is to select the most currently relevant stories for the current sprint and order them by relevancy.

How this is done is subjective, but keep your team in mind when deciding these things and make sure to always communicate to ensure everything is on track.

Scrum defines the following timeslots and durations per 1 month sprints:
 - Finish all sprint planning within 8h of meetings;
 - Have a Scrum meeting for 15 minutes everyday;
 - Review the results of the sprint with stakeholders and team within 4h at the end;
 - Retrospect with your team what went right or wrong and how to perform within 3h;
