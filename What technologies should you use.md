Picking what technologies to use for tackling your project is an important step as it can lead to either very smooth sailling or very rocky roads. However, depending on what stage you're on in your development journey, you may not have the knowledge and experience required to make the best decisions. Don't be afraid to step outside your comfort zone, do your research, talk with coworkers, and pick something you feel seems right for the job.

# Baseline Questions
Some project-agnostic categories you can look into to see what matches your needs:
 - [Deployment Environments](Deployment%20Environments.md) - Where and how can you deploy your project?
 - [Project Management - Tools](Project%20Management%20-%20Tools.md) - What tools do you need to manage your project?
 - [Languages and Libraries](Languages%20and%20Libraries.md) - What should you use for your project?

# Automation
Regardless of what technology you choose or use, make sure that whatever you do that isn't specific to 1 project facilitates future project development, by streamlining as much as you can.
Automation is key for fast & efficient workflows, a requirement for modern development.
