Scrum and Agile are about delivering the work you're expected to on a timely manner while minimizing waste, maximizing productivity and enjoyment (as far as I understand).

On smaller scale projects like independent ones or college works, there's still a lot you can transfer over, but the times established in Scrum don't really work anymore.
