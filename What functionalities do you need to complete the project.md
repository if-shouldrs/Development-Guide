After defining the abstract requirements in step 1, and determining what the barebones functionalities of our product are in step 2, it's time to break the requirements down into actionable tasks.

If the requirements defined in step 1 are insufficient or need to be updated, repeat step 1 and come back.

Once you have proper requirements, break them down into actionables (called user stories in Scrum) which will be self-assigned by each Developer to themselves.

TODO: Describe basics of how to transform requirements into user stories.

Which user stories fall on which sprint is up to the Product Owner.
