# Low-Level Project Requirements
After defining the abstract requirements in step 1, and determining what the barebones functionalities of our product are in step 2, it's time to break the requirements down into actionable tasks.

If the requirements defined in step 1 are insufficient or need to be updated, repeat step 1 and come back.

Once you have proper requirements, break them down into actionables (called user stories in Scrum) which will be self-assigned by each Developer to themselves. Basically just turn the abstract goals into concrete doable goals. It's the Product Owner's responsibility to decide which tasks land on each Sprint.

## You're going to fail
If you're starting a new project that requires you to develop things in new ways or with different tools, it's extremely unlikely you'll correctly assess how long it takes you to do anything. I recommend you double any expected time needed to do anything to have a better chance of not running out of time, but the reality is you're going to mess up and you're going to need at least 1 Sprint to figure out what's going on.
