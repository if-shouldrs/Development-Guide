# What do we have to do?
The very first step of development is to understand what our end goal is. Before we tackle specifics, we need to translate the human language of the person defining the goals of our project into engineering terms so we know what the components we're working with are.

Do we need a server? Do we need a database? How much data are we handling? Just examples of what has to be understood in this section.

Using Scrum terms, during this stage the Product Owner has meeting(s) with the Stakeholders and determines what they want. In a general sense, the goal is to determine what the requirements of the end client are.

From an engineering perspective, what do they want? What does the final product look like? Where are we trying to get to? Break it down slowly into pieces until you feel you understand all the logic without any implementation details. These should be written down on a Kanban board or similar where the whole team has access to.
