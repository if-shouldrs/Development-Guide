Here's some tips regarding what and how many languages and libraries/frameworks to use.

# Programming Language
Deciding which exact language to use for a given project could be a very complicated task. However, a lot of projects are created for an already established teams or in an already established company, so usually the language you'll use is already clear or defined.

In case you have to pick one yourself, you should brush up on what is currently used by other developers through searching forums, checking guides, etc. If you have freedom to choose a language you should use whatever makes you and your team acquire the best skills for making you competitive in the market, while making sure you achieve the project goals.

# Frameworks/Libraries
Always use as many frameworks and libraries as you can. The tech world is moving more and more towards codeless programming, the name of the game is developing faster and the more work you delegate to these tools the faster you produce results, and that's all people care about.

Currently it's unclear to me how you should do this to increase employability. There are countless frameworks and companies are always looking for people experienced in specific ones, and I'm not sure how translateable skills acquired in one framework are to a different one. Might be a good idea to always choose different frameworks whenever you have a lot of time to develop your project, in order to pad your experience as much as possible.

If your goal is to finish your product faster, then pick whatever frameworks/libraries the team is most familiar with and use that. That's probably what you'd be doing in a corporal environment.
